OVERVIEW:

 Reads a file containing exercise information and returns different statistics about
 the exercise habits


INCLUDED FILES:

 ExerciseMain.java - The driver class that the user uses to run the program
 ExerciseModel.java - This represents a model for a single exercise
 ExerciseController.java - This class has static methods which operate on the exercise list
 ExerciseFactory.java - This class parses the exercise file and adds it to the controller's list
 README - this file

BUILDING AND RUNNING:

 To run the application:
 $ javac ExerciseMain.java
 $ java ExerciseMain


PROGRAM DESIGN:

 The program can return different number of top and worst exercise days depending on what you
 set the constants to.  You can also set the minimum days needed for highest and lowest exercise.
 These basically add a search functionality which allows you to set filters.

 I have made all the classesI will be able to talk more about the program design and development in future.
